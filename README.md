# Task Tracker CLI
See https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker for a more detailed description of the project's requirements.

Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. It is implemented as a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. I developed this project to facilitate and practice creating Java applications. Specifically, this project familiarizes working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.
